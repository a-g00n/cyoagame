		<p>Three large bolts of magical energy erupt from your staff and slam into the ogre; two into his chest and one in his face. He loses his footing and drops his club as he falls to the ground hard.</p>
		<p>A magical hand extends from your staff and picks up the club and holds it above Boristraths head. His eyes lock with yours.</p>
