		<p>You wake up in your campsite to find that your traveling companion, Oron, has gone missing. You look around and notice a few sets of footprints leading away from his sleeping bag. You follow the footprints which lead to the entrance of a cave. As you enter you notice crude torches line the walls of the cavern, illuminating your path as you travel deeper into the mountainside. You come to a fork in the caverns path. You see faint light and hear muffled conversation coming from the east and only darkness from the west.</p>
